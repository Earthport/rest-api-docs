## Readme
This repo contains the documentation pages which are used to build Earthport's REST API documentation at [https://docs.earthport.com](https://docs.earthport.com)

The online documentation contains a section called Guides which contains a number of pages which are generated from the markdown files in this repo.

Currently these pages are manually added to [APimatic](https://apimatic.io) to create the documentation. However, Apimatic has its own REST APIs so we will in future be able to generate the documentation automatically from a CI/CD pipeline by checking out these changes and calling the relevant APIs.

This repo is NOT for external consumption for our clients and is intended to be used internally only.
